      <h2>Proprietary Rights</h2>
      <p>
        As between you and NSC and its affiliates, we are the owner and/or
        authorized user of any trademark or service mark appearing on the sites
        and are the copyright owner or licensee of the content, services, and
        other information on the sites, unless otherwise indicated. Except as
        otherwise provided herein, use of the sites does not grant you a license

        except as allowed herein or otherwise approved by us in writing. You may
        not download or save a copy of any content or screens, except as
        otherwise provided in these terms and conditions, for any purpose. You
        may, however, print one (1) copy of the information on the sites solely
        for your personal use or records. If you make other use of the sites,
        except as otherwise provided above, you may be in violation of copyright
        and other laws of the United States and other countries, as well as
        applicable state laws, and may be subject to liability for such
        unauthorized use. We do not grant any license or other authorization to
        any user of our trademarks, service marks, other copyrightable material,
        or any other intellectual property by including them on the sites. You
        also acknowledge and agree that any ideas, concepts, methods, systems,
        designs, plans, techniques, or other similar materials that you submit
        or otherwise communicate to the sites may be used by us in any manner.

        NSC does not represent or warrant the truthfulness, accuracy, or
        reliability of any material posted by others on or through the sites,
        nor does NSC endorse any opinions expressed by users or others. Users
        acknowledge that any reliance on material posted by others will be at
        their own risk. Any content placed in any discussion area by users is

        <li>Restrict or inhibit any other User from using the Sites;</li>

        Except as otherwise expressly permitted herein, you may not upload,
        post, publish, reproduce, transmit, or distribute in any way any
        component of the sites or derivative works with respect thereto. We have
        no obligation to monitor any content on or through the sites, and we
        assume no obligation. You acknowledge and agree, however, that we do
        retain the right to monitor the sites and to disclose any information as
        necessary or appropriate to satisfy any law, regulation, or other
        governmental request, to operate the sites properly, or to protect
        ourselves or our users. We will not intentionally monitor or disclose
        any private electronic mail message unless required by law. We reserve
        the right to refuse to post or to remove any information or materials,
        in whole or in part, that, in our sole discretion, are unacceptable,
        undesirable, inappropriate, or in violation of these terms and
        conditions. We may also suspend or terminate any user’s use of the sites
        at any time in our sole discretion. You agree to defend, indemnify, and
        hold NSC, its directors, officers, employees, agents, and affiliates
        harmless from any and all claims, liabilities, costs, and expenses,
        including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising in any way from your use
        of the sites or the placement or transmission of your material on or
        through the sites by you.
      </p>
      <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>
        The sites, including, without limitation, all content, services,
        functions, and materials thereon, are provided "as is," without warranty
        of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
        any warranty concerning the availability, accuracy or usefulness
        thereof, and any warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability
        or fitness for a particular purpose. NSC does not warrant that the sites
        (including, without limitation, the content, services, and materials
        therein) will be timely, secure, uninterrupted, or error-free or that
        defects will be corrected. NSC does not guarantee that the sites will
        meet users’ requirements. No advice, results, or information, whether
        oral or written, obtained by you from ASI or through the sites shall
        create any warranty not expressly made herein. If you are dissatisfied
        with the sites or any content or function thereon, your sole remedy is
        to discontinue using the sites.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        In no event shall NSC or its affiliates or any of the directors,
        officers, employees, or agents of the foregoing be liable for any
        indirect, direct, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, or
        punitive damages arising from or related to the use of, or the inability
        to use, the sites, including, without limitation, loss of revenue, or
        anticipated profits or lost business or lost sales, even if NSC has been
        advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not
        allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or
        consequential damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to
        certain users. In no event shall ASI be liable for or in connection with
        any content posted, transmitted, exchanged, or received by or on behalf
        of any user or other person on or through the sites.
      </p>

      <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
      <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that we have no responsibility for the
        accuracy or availability of information provided by websites to which
        you may link from the sites ("linked sites"). Links to linked sites are
        provided as a convenience to you and do not constitute an endorsement by
        or association with NSC of such sites or the content, products,
        advertising, or other materials presented on such sites. NSC does not
        author, edit, or monitor these linked sites. You acknowledge and agree
        that NSC is not responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any
        damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with
        the use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or services available
        on such linked sites.
      </p>

      <h2>Applicable Laws</h2>
      <p>
        We control and operate these Sites from our offices in Nepal. Persons
        who choose to access these Sites from other locations do so on their own
        initiative, and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and
        to the extent local laws are applicable.
      </p>

      <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
      <p>
        The Terms and Conditions and the relationship between you and NSC shall
        be governed by the laws of the State of Madhesh Pradesh, without regard
        to its conflict of law provisions. You and NSC agree that any cause of
        action that may arise under this Agreement shall be commenced and be
        heard in the appropriate court in the State of Madhesh Pradesh, Nepal.
        You and NSC each agree to submit to the personal and exclusive
        jurisdiction of the courts located within the State of Madhesh Pradesh,
        Nepal. The failure of NSC to exercise or enforce any right or provision
        of the Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right
        or provision. If any provision of the Terms and Conditions is found by a
        court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless
        agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties'
        intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of
        the Terms and Conditions remain in full force and effect. You agree that
        regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of
        action by you arising out of or related to the use of the Services or
        the Terms and Conditions must be filed within one (1) year after such
        claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
      </p>

      <h2>Modifications to the Sites and the Services</h2>
      <p>
        We may change these terms and conditions from time to time and at any
        time without notice to you, by posting such changes on the sites. We
        reserve the right, for any reason, in our sole discretion, to terminate,
        change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the site, including, but
        not limited to, content, features, or hours of availability. By using
        any of the sites following any modifications to the terms and
        conditions, you agree to be bound by any such modifications to the terms
        and conditions. We may also impose limits on certain features of the
        sites or restrict your access to part or all of the sites without notice
        or penalty.
      </p>
